&lt;p&gt;With my girlfriend travelling through Europe and some spare time on my hands I
decided to build some &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/diy-overnightsensations"&gt;Overnight
Sensations&lt;/a&gt;
for her. The design is by the one and only Paul Carmody - I'm still impressed
by his Speedster speakers which sit unfinished on my desk because I can't stop
listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Parts for the cabinets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 x 23,0cm x 15,4cm x 1,2cm &lt;em&gt;Front&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 x 15,3cm x 19,1cm x 1,2cm &lt;em&gt;Top / Bottom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 x 19,1cm x 22,9cm x 1,2cm &lt;em&gt;Sides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 x 12,9cm x 20,5cm x 1,2cm &lt;em&gt;Back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front is a bit larger than necessary so it's possible to flush-trim it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building the cabinets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the wood cut to the right sizes directly at the hardware store. At home I
used a handheld circular saw to cut the edges to 45°.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="45° Cut" src="https://flopska.com/images/overnightsensations/degree_cut.JPG"&gt;
&lt;img alt="All parts together" src="https://flopska.com/images/overnightsensations/all_parts.JPG"&gt;
The angle was set using a triangle because the scale on the saw is a bit off.
The cut is not perfect - a table saw would be better but I can live with the
result. I think the main problem is the missing guide rail but those things are
expensive...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to glue the sides together. Here the mitred edges come into
play: Instead of clamping the cabinet it is possible to use tension belts.
This has the benefit of a perfectly square box shortening the time spend
sanding the edges and greatly simplifying the veneering afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Clamping the box" src="https://flopska.com/images/overnightsensations/tension_belt.JPG"&gt;
With the edges appearently not being 45 degrees straight there is a small gap
between the parts. This has to be levelled later and shows how a better
preparation would've payed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is cutting the holes for the terminals and the bass reflex in the back,
using a holesaw this is straightforward. The diameters are 5cm and 4,5cm
respectively.
&lt;img alt="Cutting holes in the back" src="https://flopska.com/images/overnightsensations/back.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one step left, putting the backs in... They fit very well, the mitred
edges seem to work. After sanding everything to make it level, filling the
edges with my glue / sanding-dust combination, sanding, filling and sanding
again, this is how they look:
&lt;img alt="Putting it all together" src="https://flopska.com/images/overnightsensations/cabinets_glued.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up are the baffles and the veneering.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
