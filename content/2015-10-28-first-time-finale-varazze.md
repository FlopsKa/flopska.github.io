Title: Monte Cucco - First visit to Finale and Varazze in Italy

I bought my Van (a VW T4 Transporter) at the end of September. A few people from the climbing gym in Karlsruhe went to Finale at the start of October and I planned to join them there when I finished my camper conversion. Sebastian, a friend of mine, had some spare time on his hands and we decided to drive together to Italy.  

I raced the camper conversion but it turned out to work well anyways. After an exhausting drive we arrived at the camping in the dark and fell to sleep in an instant. The next morning we met the rest of the people from Karlsruhe and after a short breakfast went climbing together. Having slept only 4 hours our climbing looked more like this:

We did some easy climbing that day and tried to get used to the rock. The weather was perfect to rest in the sun.

### Varazze ###

After some climbing the following days a few people decided to drive to Varazze which is around 30 minutes away from the campsite. The picture shows Alex bouldering a 6c on the Gioia boulder which sits right at the beginning of the area.

We enjoyed some of the easier boulders there and I started to work the moves of *Messa Delle Streghe (7c)* which escaped me that day. On a site note it's appearently possible to climb the upper part of the problem, too. When I understand the guidebook correctly it's graded *7c+* when you do the highball exit.

### Finale ###
Next up was some climbing in the Alveare sector in Finale. The sector is the home of the two famous routes *Viaggio Nel Futuro 7c+* and *Hyaena 8b/+*. The sun is burning into it so it might be better to go there on a cloudy day but we enjoyed the time in the sun and worked our tan.

According to the guidebook *Viaggio* was supposed to be Finale's first 8a but after someone found new beta it turned out to be *just* 7c+. I still think it's very hard :).

Over the next week I went there two more times but was not able to climb it because I kept falling off the dyno to the huge jug.

After the rest of the people from Karlsruhe left for the drive back home I met two guys from Augsburg, Germany: Benny and Chris. It turned out they know the same people in Karlsruhe I know - of course we went climbing together. When we weren't climbing we had awesome meals and some good talks going on.
