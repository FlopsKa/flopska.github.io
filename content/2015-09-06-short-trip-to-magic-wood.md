Title: Short 4 Day Trip To Magic Wood

Patrick, Lukas and I went to Magic Wood from 24.07 to 27.7 again. Patrick had a
car from his parents and we all had some free time and a lot of psyche to try
ourselves on some of Avers' classics. With the unspoken goal of finally
climbing our first 8a we arrived friday noon and set out to try *Foxy Lady
(8a)* and *The Right Hand Of Darkness (8a)*. Still not able to climb one of
those boulders Patrick and I at least wanted to ascent the uber-famous
*Supernova (7c)* while Lukas, having already climbed this gem, wanted to try
*Jack The Chipper (7c)*.
