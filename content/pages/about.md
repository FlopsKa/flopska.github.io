I'm Florian, welcome to my blog.

I work as a software developer at Fiducia & GAD IT AG. In my free time I study
computer science at KIT with an emphasis on machine learning where I am
currently in the process of writing my master thesis.

This blog serves as a general notepad - I document some stuff I do or find out.
I heard writing helps to organize one's thoughts, so, yeah...

As I really love climbing I started working on a route management system for
climbing gyms some time ago which is now official, thanks to [Patrick
Gebert](http://patrickgebert.de). More information is available at
