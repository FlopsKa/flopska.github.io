I'm Florian, welcome to my blog.

Currently I pursue my PhD at the Institute for Program & Data Structures (IPD) at KIT University.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software developer at Fiducia & GAD IT AG. Here I helped to build the fraud detection system and what is called the "Smart Data Lab".

This blog serves as a general notepad - I document some stuff I do or find out.
I heard writing helps to organize one's thoughts, so, yeah...

As I really love climbing I started working on a route management system for
climbing gyms some time ago which is now official, thanks to [Patrick
Gebert](http://patrickgebert.de). More information is available at
[routestack.de](http://routestack.de). Please contact us if you are interested.
