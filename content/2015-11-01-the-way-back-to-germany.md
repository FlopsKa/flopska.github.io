Title: I am featured in a climbing video?!

After the trip to Italy I planned to visit a friend in Rosenheim. Driving there I stopped in Chironico and tried some more boulders. I arrived late at night and directly went to sleep. The next morning I got to know some Spaniards living in ZÃ¼rich and we went to try *Confessions of a crap artist 7c+*. We did some moves on *Matusalem 6c+* to warmup and [http://www.edoardomoruzzi.com/](Edoardo Moruzzi) captured some of it on video.

Afterwards we drove to the upper area and tried *Vitruvian Man* which is a bit of a weird boulder: Someone chipped a large jug into the roof which turned the 7c problem into a 7a-ish one. You can still climb the 7c but you have to use a rather small crimp next to the jug. I climbed the 7a a few years ago so I went for the 7c. Being able to do all of the three single moves I thought it would be easy to link them - somehow the boulder escaped me, though.

The next day I played on *Freak Brothers 8a* for a short time but being really exhausted from the trip to Italy and the bouldering the day before I continued my drive to Rosenheim where I was welcomed with an awesome pizza.
