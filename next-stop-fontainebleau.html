    <p>My plan for Fontainebleau was clear: Do something for my Karma and send this boulder from Fred Nicole! Made famous by Ben Moon's and Jerry Moffat's <em>The Real Thing</em> everyone knows about this kind of special 8a+ in the forest. I wanted to give it a shot at least...</p>
<p>We (Thomas and myself) arrived at Fontainebleau in the dark after a heart-stopping moment where the van got stuck in the wet meadow next to the highway when I tried to turn round because we missed the exit. Luckily Thomas was able to push the car forward till it unstuck. The rest of the drive was boring in comparison.</p>
<p>The area is famous for its shit wheather. We experienced it so-so: It didn't rain and the sun came out frequently but somehow a lot of the boulders stayed wet. Appearently it rained <em>a lot</em> before we arrived and I believe the soaked ground did its magic to keep everything from drying.</p>
<p>We still had a lot of fun on the dry or partly dry boulders and Fontainebleau showed us once more just how difficult the different grades are. Being shut down on Karma (I could do the first move but had no chance on the second one) we explored the different areas a bit and tried a lot of the problems in the 5+6 guidebook. Sadly we didn't take many pictures :( For me the best day was the one where we tried to climb the red parcour in the Bas Cuvier area. We didn't manage it completely but the diversity of the problems in the parcour is just awesome: slabs, roofs, vertical climbing and there's even a crack-problem in it. Next time we'll do it fully :)</p>

<p>Our takeaways from the trip: Don't go to the swimming pool in Arbonne-la-forÃªt to take a shower: It's expensive, they don't allow you to wear regular swimming pants, they don't have nice showers and the pool itself is very small. The shower at <a href="http://www.fontaineblhostel.com/">Fontaineblhostel</a> on the other hand is very nice.</p>
<p>I didn't manage to climb Karma, I put three sessions into it but couldn't do the second move. I will come back stronger.    </p>
