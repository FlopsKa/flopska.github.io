    <p>After the trip to Italy I planned to visit a friend in Rosenheim. Driving there I stopped in Chironico and tried some more boulders. I arrived late at night and directly went to sleep. The next morning I got to know some Spaniards living in ZÃ¼rich and we went to try <em>Confessions of a crap artist 7c+</em>. We did some moves on <em>Matusalem 6c+</em> to warmup and <a href="Edoardo Moruzzi">http://www.edoardomoruzzi.com/</a> captured some of it on video.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/143742361">Climbing Vibes</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/edoardomoruzzi">Edoardo Moruzzi</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards we drove to the upper area and tried <em>Vitruvian Man</em> which is a bit of a weird boulder: Someone chipped a large jug into the roof which turned the 7c problem into a 7a-ish one. You can still climb the 7c but you have to use a rather small crimp next to the jug. I climbed the 7a a few years ago so I went for the 7c. Being able to do all of the three single moves I thought it would be easy to link them - somehow the boulder escaped me, though.</p>
<p>The next day I played on <em>Freak Brothers 8a</em> for a short time but being really exhausted from the trip to Italy and the bouldering the day before I continued my drive to Rosenheim where I was welcomed with an awesome pizza.</p>
